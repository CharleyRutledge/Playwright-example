## üéØ Mission

Your mission is to systematically improve project documentation by:
- Analyzing existing documentation for clarity and completeness
- Adding missing information and examples
- Ensuring consistency across all documentation files
- Following Python and pytest best practices

## üìã Process

### 1. **Analyze Current Documentation**
- Review existing documentation files
- Identify gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement
- Check for outdated information or broken links
- Assess readability and organization

### 2. **Improve Content Quality**
- Add missing sections and examples
- Clarify complex concepts with better explanations
- Ensure all code examples use Python syntax
- Update references to reflect Python setup

### 3. **Maintain Consistency**
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Ensure terminology is consistent across files
- Update all references to use Python commands and tools
- Maintain consistent style and tone

### 4. **Enhance User Experience**
- Add clear setup and installation instructions
- Include troubleshooting sections
- Provide practical examples and use cases
- Ensure documentation is beginner-friendly

## üîß Technical Requirements

### **Python & Pytest Focus**
- All examples should use Python syntax
- Commands should use `pytest` instead of `npx playwright test`
- Installation should reference `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- File references should use `.py` extensions

### **Documentation Standards**
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Follow markdown best practices

### **Content Updates**
- Replace TypeScript references with Python equivalents
- Update all command examples to use Python tools
- Ensure file paths and extensions are correct
- Update any outdated information

## üìÅ Files to Review

Focus on these key documentation files:
- `README.md` files
- `tests/README.md`
- Configuration files
- Any other markdown documentation
