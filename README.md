# Playwright Example Project

This project demonstrates Playwright automation testing with Python and Pytest, following the official Playwright documentation patterns and Testing Rules.

## Project Rules

This project follows the rules defined in `rules/Starting Rules.md` and `rules/Testing Rules.md`:

### Core Rules
- **Rule 1**: Use Playwright for browser automation
- **Rule 2**: Use Pytest for test framework
- **Rule 3**: Use Python as the programming language
- **Rule 4**: Only follow the official Playwright documents
- **Rule 5**: Only use Official Playwright Documentation for design patterns
- **Rule 6**: Use Playwright MCP to run the browser in order to find locators
- **Rule 7**: If you can't use Playwright MCP, open the browser and Find the locators
- **Rule 8**: Do not deviate, If you have Fix it
- **Rule 9**: Before writing any code, Make sure it meets these rules

### Commenting Rules
- **Rule 1**: Make sure to write short, concise comments for all code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

## Configuration

This project follows the official Playwright documentation for test configuration:

### Base URL Configuration
The project uses base URL configuration as recommended in the [official Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options):

```python
# In conftest.py
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def browser_context_args():
    return {
        "base_url": "https://playwright.dev",
        # ... other options
    }
```

This allows tests to use relative URLs:
```python
# Instead of: page.goto("https://playwright.dev/")
page.goto("/")  # Uses base URL automatically
```

### Storage State Configuration
The project supports storage state for authentication as documented in the [official Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options):

```python
# In conftest.py
"storage_state": "state.json",  # For authentication
```

### Additional Configuration Options
Following the official documentation, the project includes:

- **Viewport settings**: `{"width": 1920, "height": 1080}`
- **HTTP headers**: Custom headers for all requests
- **HTTPS error handling**: `ignore_https_errors: True`
- **Browser launch options**: Headless mode, slow motion for debugging

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Filtering by Markers
```bash
# Run only smoke tests (quick validation)
pytest -m smoke

# Run only regression tests (comprehensive)
pytest -m regression

# Run only slow tests
pytest -m slow

# Run all tests EXCEPT slow ones
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Browser Selection
```bash
# Run with specific browser
pytest --browser chromium
pytest --browser firefox
pytest --browser webkit
```

### Headless/Headed Mode
```bash
# Run in headless mode (no browser UI)
pytest --headed=false

# Run with browser UI visible
pytest --headed=true
```

### Specific Test Files
```bash
# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_example.py

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_example.py::TestExample

# Run specific test method
pytest tests/test_example.py::TestExample::test_basic_navigation
```

### Allure Reporting

This project uses Allure reporting for comprehensive test reporting and visualization.

**Generate Allure Report:**
```bash
# Run tests to generate Allure results
pytest tests/ -v

# Generate and serve Allure report locally
allure serve allure-results

# Generate static Allure report
allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
allure open allure-report
```

**Features of Allure reporting:**
- ✅ **Rich test visualization**: Interactive test results with detailed information
- ✅ **Test categorization**: Tests organized by severity, status, and features
- ✅ **Screenshots on failure**: Automatic screenshot capture and attachment
- ✅ **Page content on failure**: HTML content saved for debugging
- ✅ **Test history**: Track test results over time
- ✅ **Environment information**: Browser, platform, and configuration details
- ✅ **CI/CD integration**: Automatic report generation in GitHub Actions

### Playwright Recording Features

This project uses Playwright's built-in recording capabilities to capture comprehensive test execution data.

**Key Features:**
- 📊 **Trace Recording**: Detailed execution traces with screenshots, snapshots, and source code
- 🎥 **Video Recording**: Full video recordings of test execution
- 📸 **Screenshot on Failure**: Automatic screenshots when tests fail
- 📄 **Page Content**: HTML content saved on test failures for debugging
- 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup**: Configurable cleanup of old recordings

**Using Playwright Recording:**

```bash
# Run tests with all recording features enabled
pytest

# Run with visible browser (great for debugging)
pytest --headed

# Run specific test with tracing
pytest tests/test_example.py::test_search_functionality

# Run with slow motion for detailed observation
pytest --slowmo 2000
```

**Viewing Recordings:**

```bash
# Open trace file in Playwright's interactive trace viewer
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace_20241201_143022.zip

# View videos directly (open in any video player)
# Files are located in: test-results/videos/

# View screenshots directly (open in any image viewer)
# Files are located in: test-results/screenshot_*.png

```

**Recording Directory Structure:**
```
test-results/
├── trace_20241201_143022.zip      # Detailed execution trace

## Design Patterns

This project follows official Playwright documentation patterns:

### Page Object Model (POM)
```python
class PlaywrightHomePage:
    def __init__(self, page: Page):
        self.page = page
        self.search_button = page.get_by_role("button", name="Search (Ctrl+K)")
    
    def navigate(self):
        self.page.goto("/")  # Uses base URL
```

### Role-Based Selectors
```python
# Accessibility-first selectors
page.get_by_role("button", name="Search (Ctrl+K)")
page.get_by_role("searchbox", name="Search")
page.get_by_role("link", name="Docs")
```

### Web-First Assertions
```python
# Auto-retrying assertions
expect(page).to_have_title("...")
expect(page.locator("h1")).to_contain_text("...")
expect(search_box).to_have_value("python")
```

## Official Documentation Compliance

This project follows the [official Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options) for:

- ✅ **Base URL configuration** - Allows using relative URLs
- ✅ **Storage state configuration** - For authentication scenarios
- ✅ **Viewport settings** - Consistent browser window size
- ✅ **HTTP headers** - Custom headers for all requests
- ✅ **HTTPS error handling** - Ignore SSL certificate errors
- ✅ **Browser launch options** - Headless mode, slow motion
- ✅ **Role-based selectors** - Accessibility-first approach
- ✅ **Web-first assertions** - Auto-retrying assertions
- ✅ **Explicit waits** - No sleep() calls

## Best Practices

### Accessibility Testing
- Using role-based selectors for better accessibility
- Following WCAG guidelines for test selectors

### Test Reliability
- Web-first assertions that auto-retry
- Explicit waits instead of sleep()
- Proper test isolation with fresh contexts

### Maintainability
- Page Object Model for UI element management
- Comprehensive commenting throughout code
- Clear test organization and naming

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Browser not found**: Run `playwright install`
2. **Tests failing**: Check if base URL is accessible
3. **Slow tests**: Adjust `slow_mo` in conftest.py

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with browser visible and slow motion
pytest --headed --slowmo 2000
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing in CI/CD pipelines.

### GitHub Actions Features:
- ✅ **Automated testing** on push and pull requests
- ✅ **Allure reports** automatically generated and published
- ✅ **Test recordings preserved** as artifacts (30 days retention)
- ✅ **Cross-platform testing** on Ubuntu runners
- ✅ **Automatic dependency installation**

### Viewing CI Results:
1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Click on any workflow run
3. View **Allure report** in the workflow summary
4. Download **artifacts** to view:
   - `test-recordings/` - Videos, traces, screenshots
   - `allure-results/` - Raw Allure test data

### Local vs CI Differences:
- **Local**: Use `allure serve allure-results` to view reports
- **CI**: Allure reports published automatically in workflow
- **CI**: Test recordings uploaded as downloadable artifacts
